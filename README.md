# 🧠 Agent + Commands System

Think of it as a **brain** sitting between your **users' questions** and your **backend functionalities**.

---

## ✨ What's Inside?

- `agent.ts` → The smart **brain** that talks to OpenAI and decides what tool/command to use.
- `commandHandlers.ts` → Your real **functions** that handle different actions (search, balance, checkout, etc.).
- `handleAgentDecision.ts` → The **router** that connects decisions to the right handlers.

---

## 🚀 How To Use In Your Project

1. **Install OpenAI SDK** (if you haven't yet):

```bash
npm install openai
```

2. **Set up your API keys**  environment variables.

3. **Plug the agent into your app** wherever you get user input:
   
```ts
import { agent } from './agent';
import { handleAgentDecision } from './handleAgentDecision';

const userInput = "I want to check my balance.";
const userId = 456; // however you track users

const main = async () => {
  const decision = await agent({ query: userInput, userId });
  await handleAgentDecision(decision, userId);
};

main();
```

Now your app **understands commands in plain English** and does the right thing automatically.

## 🎨 How To Personalize It

You can make this system your own very easily:

|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Agent (decision prompt) | Change the prompt in `agent.ts` to reflect your domain (e.g., if you’re building a fitness app, adjust commands accordingly). |
| Command Handlers | Add, remove, or rename commands inside `commandHandlers.ts`. |
| Cart Manager | Make the `cart_manager` handle real database storage, not just console logs. |
| Memory | Use the Upstach Redis Memory for better memory for the system |

You are in full control. 🎮

## 🛠️ How To Extend It

This structure was made to be super easy to extend:

- **Add More Commands**:  
Just add a new function in `commandHandlers.ts` and tell the agent prompt about it.

- **Error Handling**:  
Add retries if OpenAI times out, or fallback responses if no decision could be made.

- **Smarter Cart**:  
Move cart items into a per-user object or DB table to make it fully functional.

## 📦 Why It's Awesome

- You **don't need to hardcode menus and commands**.
- Users can **talk naturally** to your app.
- You can **grow** your app's "intelligence" without touching the frontend.
- It's **easy to debug** — just log the decision if something feels wrong.
